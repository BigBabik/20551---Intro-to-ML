The program contains three main files
    1. Algo.py - pythonic implementations of the algorithms in the excerise
    2. Puzzle.py - for the 8-puzzle framework
    3. Tiles.py - main file for calling algorithms and user input

The primary data structure is PuzzleState - holds information about a given puzzle state
        - board: 2D list representation of the board state
        - config: stores the flat initial configuration
        - children: holds child nodes generated from this node
        - blank_row: row index of the blank tile
        - blank_col: column index of the blank tile
        - goal: stores the goal configuration
        - cost_function: function for calculating node cost

The representation chosen for a State (and thus for the state space) is a list
of integers that are the elements on the tile board.
A transition between states is defined by the action that is taken, and the new state
is the result of that function. As a pose to the textbook, a move is defined
by the direction in which a non zero tile is moved, and not by the direction the
blank is moved to (these are always opposite). This is more intuitive in my opinion.

GBFS heuristic - Sum of all diffs of the tile from the expected value -
                 elementwise subtraction of state and goal, absoluted and summed

A* heuristic - Euclidian distance of each tile from it's square
